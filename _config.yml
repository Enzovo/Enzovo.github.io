          There is one project about an online Tic-tac-toe game, which is implemented in C language. This server can allow multiple games to be played together, which use <mark>select</mark> to handle blocking I/O.   

          Also, a classic chess game with an Android Application is here. If you are a chessman, don't hesitate to clone it and start one game with your friend or in-game AI(not a really smart one).  

          And, a fast trajectory re-planning project is also here. It implements <mark>A*</mark> Algorithm with Python that is applied to the agent maze event.

          My time at Rutgers was truly exceptional. As a multicultural institution, I rarely encountered any cultural barriers, and Rutgers' inclusive environment facilitated my swift integration into the community as a Chinese student. In the Computer Science major, I had the opportunity to delve into a variety of programming languages. For instance, I gained proficiency in C language through the <mark>System Programming</mark> course and honed my skills in designing interactive interfaces and functions in the <mark>Software Methodology</mark> course. Additionally, I delved into the realm of data structures and algorithms, exploring various algorithmic concepts in the <mark>Introduction to Algorithms</mark> course, which significantly heightened my interest in this field.  

          Furthermore, my coursework included acquiring knowledge in data management through the study of <mark>Data Management</mark> where I gained proficiency in tools such as <mark>NumPy</mark>, <mark>Pandas</mark>, and <mark>Matplotlib</mark>. These skills equipped me with the ability to effectively process and analyze data.
